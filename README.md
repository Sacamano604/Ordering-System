Ordering System
==============

Recreating my php final from BCIT. Ordering system which lets you add/remove/edit products, clients, and orders. Will provide sql files and admin creds once completed.

June 12: Folder structure and connection string for DB inserted. Will push to be able to at least add clients to the DB by the end of the day...

June 12: Table and form to add clients to the database is complete. Validator added to make sure two emails don't class, as well as other validation for form fields
